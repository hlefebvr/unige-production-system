This repository contains my lecture notes from a course given at the University of Study of Genova on "Production systems". It explores two main topics which are :
- Inventory management
    - Continuous review (both deterministic and stochastic model)
    - Periodic review (Wagner-Miller theorem, Silver-Mill heuristic)
- Bill of materials
- Production scheduling
